# TODOs

- Add traces for debugging what gets compared
- Enhanced location highlighting for semantic issues with precise line numbers, spec references, and code context display, take inspiration from compiler errors that look nice (rust for instance).
- Add `init` or `create` command to create your initial config
- Allow URL spec definitions (i.e. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.txt)
