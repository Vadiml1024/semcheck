# TODOs

Maturity
- clean up config file structure around 'files' and 'specs' (drop 'specs.path' key, rename 'files' to 'impls'?)
- Option to check a single rule
- Fail fast option
- Add rule names to issues
- Remove confidence
- Better error handling
- try thinking models

Cool
- Implementation or specification 'quotes' to be displayed along issues
  - or more generally, improve UX when trying to backtrack an issue to it's origin
- Have a "thinking" preview in the terminal saying things like "considering function arguments in config validation..."
- Github Action
- Parallel Execution
